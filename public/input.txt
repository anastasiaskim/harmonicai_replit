# Sample Text File with Sections

This is the introduction text that appears before any sections.
It might contain multiple paragraphs or lines of text.

## Section 1

This is the content of section 1.
It contains several lines of text.

Some of these lines might be separated by blank lines,
which should be preserved in the output.

## Section 2

The content of section 2 starts here.
This section demonstrates the parser's ability to:
- Recognize section headers
- Group content correctly
- Handle different types of formatting

## Section 3

This is section 3, which is the final section of our sample text.
The parser should correctly identify this as the third section.

It should also properly include all of this text as part of section 3,
even though there are blank lines in between.

## Section 4

This section includes a code sample:

```
function example() {
  console.log("This is a code block");
  return true;
}
```

The parser should preserve the formatting of this code block.

## Section 5

This is the final section of our sample document.
When displayed in the browser, this text should appear under the "Section 5" heading.
